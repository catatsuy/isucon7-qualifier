=head1 NAME

DateTime::Format::MySQL - Parse and format MySQL dates and times

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DateTime::Format::MySQL;

  my $dt = DateTime::Format::MySQL->parse_datetime( '2003-01-16 23:12:01' );

  # 2003-01-16 23:12:01
  DateTime::Format::MySQL->format_datetime($dt);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module understands the formats used by MySQL for its DATE,
DATETIME, TIME, and TIMESTAMP data types.  It can be used to parse
these formats in order to create DateTime objects, and it can take a
DateTime object and produce a string representing it in the MySQL
format.

=head1 METHODS

This class offers the following methods.  All of the parsing methods
set the returned DateTime object's time zone to the floating time
zone, because MySQL does not provide time zone information.

=over 4

=item * parse_datetime($string)

=item * parse_date($string)

=item * parse_timestamp($string)

Given a value of the appropriate type, this method will return a new
C<DateTime> object.  The time zone for this object will always be the
floating time zone, because by MySQL stores the local datetime, not
UTC.

If given an improperly formatted string, this method may die.

=item * format_date($datetime)

=item * format_time($datetime)

=item * format_datetime($datetime)

Given a C<DateTime> object, this methods returns an appropriately
formatted string.
